The functional data analysis was performed on the weather data set 'aemet' from the R library ‘fda.usc’ based in Spain. It was collected every single day over the period of 29 years and the daily average was found. 

Results for two variables, wind speed and temperature were presented.


The functional data analyses consisted of:

>Analysis of describtive statistic: mean, standard deviation and covariance surface, <br />
First and second derivatives,<br />
Principal Component Analysis,<br />
Functional depth of observed curves: Fraiman-Muniz and Modal depth, <br />
Functional outliers detection and box plots, <br />
Hypothesis testing, <br />
Pointwise fANOVA, Functional ANOVA and MANOVA, Functional basis for FP type test, Two sample F-type-test
